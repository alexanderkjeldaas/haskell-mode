;;; Commentary:

;; This is a general fields sorting function much like
;; `sort-regexp-fields', but with an extra argument that selects which
;; regexp function to use.  Emacs provides both fast-and-erroneous and
;; slow-and-correct versions (the default and the posix version).

;;; Code:

(require 'sort)

;;;###autoload
(defun general-sort-regexp-fields (reverse record-regexp key-regexp beg end
                                   rx-fn)
  "Sort the region lexicographically as specified by RECORD-REGEXP and KEY.

RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units which should be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines RECORD-REGEXP would be \"^.*$\"
KEY specifies the part of each record (ie each match for RECORD-REGEXP)
  is to be used for sorting.
  If it is \"\\\\digit\" then the digit'th \"\\\\(...\\\\)\" match field from
  RECORD-REGEXP is used.
  If it is \"\\\\&\" then the whole record is used.
  Otherwise, it is a regular-expression for which to search within the record.
If a match for KEY is not found within a record then that record is ignored.

With a negative prefix arg sorts in reverse order.

The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line
 starting with the letter \"f\",
 RECORD-REGEXP would be \"^.*$\" and KEY would be \"\\\\=\\<f\\\\w*\\\\>\"

RX-FN is the forward regexp search function to use.  Typically
this should be `re-search-forward' or `posix-search-forward'"
  ;; using negative prefix arg to mean "reverse" is now inconsistent with
  ;; other sort-.*fields functions but then again this was before, since it
  ;; didn't use the magnitude of the arg to specify anything.
